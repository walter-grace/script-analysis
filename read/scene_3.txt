EXT. HOLE IN THE WALL - NIGHT 40 40*
AROUND A CAMPFIRE WE FIND Butch, Isom, Carver, and Elzy.  
Several yards away, MAUDE DAVIS, a female cowboy in her 
20’s, cooks some food over another fire.  
ISOM
Whatcha gonna do with your share of the 
loot, Butch?  Retire?
BUTCH
Nobody lives long enough to retire from 
this, Isom.
ISOM
But you still didn’t answer the question. 
BUTCH
You remember Mike and Alice Cassidy?
ISOM
Of course.  The folks that adopted ya.
BUTCH
You know Mike has since passed on.  I’ve 
been thinking about buying me a small 
ranch close to their property near 
Dubois.  Help Alice out some, on account 
she’s all alone now.
ISOM
That’s really nice of ya, Butch.
Butch nods.  Isom really struggles to absorb this.
ISOM(CONT'D)
But what are ya going to do on a ranch?  
Be a rancher?
Butch turns to him.  Looks Isom in the eye.
BUTCH
Someone was killed today, Isom.  I don’t 
want no more of what happened today on my 
conscience.  
ISOM
Well, someone was bound to get killed 
sooner or later.  
Butch looks at him, mildly irritated.

So now that you got your share of the 
money, it don’t matter that Eddie was 
killed?
Isom struggles with a response, realizing his 
inconsistent comments regarding the robbery. 
ISOM
Nah, it ain’t that, Butch. 
(changes the subject)
But we’re talkin’ about you, anyway.  You 
being a rancher and all.  That’s what ya 
really want?
Butch gathers his thoughts.
BUTCH
I want be like Mike Cassidy.  I want to 
wake up everyday doing the same thing--
having chores, tending to the animals, 
having real work to do.  When I was 
growing up with him, I liked that things 
had to be done, work had to be done-- 
everyday.  Everyday I had 
responsibilities.
Isom stares at Butch in complete disbelief.  After a 
pause, Isom starts laughing.
ISOM
You’re pulling my leg, ain’t ya?
BUTCH
No, I’m not.
And there is only seriousness in Butch’s words, and 
expression.  Isom can see his friend is being sincere, 
and stops laughing.
ISOM
Well...  Okay, if that’s what ya want.
BUTCH
I don’t expect you to understand.
