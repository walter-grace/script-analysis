EXT. ROCK QUARRY - MORNING 74 74
Butch pounces on Sundance, and the two get into a brawl. *
Etta CRACKS Sundance across the back of his head with the 
butt of her pistol.  
Butch gets to his feet with the help of Etta.  
Etta COCKS the trigger on her pistol, and levels it at 
Sundance’s head! And just as Etta is about to pull the *
trigger...
BUTCH
Stop.  Don’t kill him, Etta.  You’ll only 
regret it.
Etta hesitates.  Sundance taunts her....
SUNDANCE
Go on, listen to your boyfriend.
BUTCH
Shut up, Sundance!
Sundance clenches his jaw.  Etta hasn’t budged.  It’s 
tense.
BEHIND THE ROCK Chas raises his pistol to aim at Etta, 
then- TOOOOOT!  *
Butch realizes...
BUTCH(CONT'D)
Etta!  The train!  It’s leaving, come on!
Butch starts but Etta hasn’t moved.  Butch grabs her arm.
BUTCH(CONT'D)
Etta?  The gold.  Let’s stick to the 
plan.
Etta gives Sundance one final glare, then she and Butch 
run off.
