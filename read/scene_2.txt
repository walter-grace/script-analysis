EXT. UNION PACIFIC RAIL STATION - PLATFORM - DAY 8 8
Towards the front, just like in their practice heist 
prior, we find Butch, Carver, Elzy, and Isom.  
A YOUNG MOTHER struggles to push her baby carriage onto 
the platform.  Butch takes notice, and crosses over to 
assist her.
BUTCH
Let me help you with that, Ma’am.
MOTHER
Thank you.
Butch gently picks up the front of the carriage and lifts 
it.  Together, they softly set it down on the deck.  
Butch straightens up, looks into the carriage.  Smiles at 
the child in it.
BUTCH
Shooo, what a pretty young lady.  
He looks up to the Mother and tips his hat.  
MOTHER
Thank you.  Thank you, kindly.
BUTCH
My pleasure, ma’am.
She moves off down the platform.  Butch walks back over 
to his position.  Isom leans into him.
ISOM
Butch Cassidy breaking all them young 
hearts.  Even the one’s that’s taken.
BUTCH
We got a train pulling into the station 
any minute.  Quiet down.
ISOM
Yeah, yeah of course, Butch.  Was only 
kidding around.
Butch looks down the ramp at Curry, Kilpatrick and Laura.  
Gives them a nod to get ready.  Quietly to his guys...
BUTCH
Alright, here we go.
